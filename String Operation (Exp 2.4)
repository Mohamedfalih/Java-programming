Write a Java program to perform the following operations on a given sentence
using methods of String and StringBuffer class:
• Print the total number of characters in the string.
• Display the character at the 5th position.
• Extract a part of the string from character 6 to 12 and print it.
• Convert the string to all uppercase and all lowercase.
• Remove any leading and trailing spaces from the string. 
• Compare the string with another string both case-sensitively and case-
insensitively.
• Check if the string contains a specific word (e.g., "Fun").
• Replace one word in the string with another (e.g., replace "Fun" with
"Awesome").
• Find the position of the word "is" in the string.
• Break the string into words and print each word on a new line.

SOURCE CODE:

package Inheritance;

public class StringOperations {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        String sentence = "   Java Programming is Powerful and Versatile.   ";

        // 1. Total number of characters
        System.out.println("Original String: \"" + sentence + "\"");
        System.out.println("Total characters: " + sentence.length());

        // 2. Character at the 5th position (index 4, since indexing starts at 0)
        if (sentence.length() >= 5) {
            System.out.println("Character at 5th position: " + sentence.charAt(4));
        }

        // 3. Extract substring from 6 to 12
        if (sentence.length() >= 12) {
            System.out.println("Substring from 6 to 12: " + sentence.substring(5, 12));
        }

        // 4. Convert to uppercase and lowercase
        System.out.println("Uppercase: " + sentence.toUpperCase());
        System.out.println("Lowercase: " + sentence.toLowerCase());

        // 5. Remove leading and trailing spaces
        String trimmed = sentence.trim();
        System.out.println("Trimmed string: \"" + trimmed + "\"");

        // 6. Compare with another string
        String another = "java programming is powerful and versatile.";
        System.out.println("Case-sensitive comparison: " + trimmed.equals(another));
        System.out.println("Case-insensitive comparison: " + trimmed.equalsIgnoreCase(another));

        // 7. Check if string contains a word
        System.out.println("Contains 'Powerful'?: " + trimmed.contains("Powerful"));

        // 8. Replace word
        String replaced = trimmed.replace("Powerful", "Amazing");
        System.out.println("After replacement: " + replaced);

        // 9. Find position of "is"
        int pos = trimmed.indexOf("is");
        System.out.println("Position of 'is': " + pos);

        // 10. Break into words and print each
        System.out.println("Words in the string:");
        String[] words = trimmed.split(" ");
        for (String word : words) {
            System.out.println(word);
        }

        // Example of StringBuffer usage (append, insert, delete, etc.)
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(trimmed);
        sb.append(" Let's crab it!!!!");
        System.out.println("StringBuffer example: " + sb);
    }
}

OUTPUT:

Original String: "   Java Programming is Powerful and Versatile.   "
Total characters: 49
Character at 5th position: a
Substring from 6 to 12: va Prog
Uppercase:    JAVA PROGRAMMING IS POWERFUL AND VERSATILE.   
Lowercase:    java programming is powerful and versatile.   
Trimmed string: "Java Programming is Powerful and Versatile."
Case-sensitive comparison: false
Case-insensitive comparison: true
Contains 'Powerful'?: true
After replacement: Java Programming is Amazing and Versatile.
Position of 'is': 17
Words in the string:
Java
Programming
is
Powerful
and
Versatile.
StringBuffer example: Java Programming is Powerful and Versatile. Let's crab it!!!!
